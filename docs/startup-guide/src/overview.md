# Overview

Welcome to the Launchpad: Software Startup Guide.

Launchpad is designed to meet the goal of being a starter kit for quickly building secure & performant modern applications. Our motto is "Ease of use, performance, flexibility, choose three."

Right now this is a simple guide for how to launch a software startup with Launchpad. As Launchpad is developed this guide will be used to keep notes on various aspects of the startup process.

The Launchpad software repository consists of various components that are served in an integrated manner. Similar to the way Ruby on Rails uses its defaults to kickstart software applications, Launchpad aims to provide a stable foundation for your next business.

If you don't agree with the technologies used or the decisions made, feel free to swap in your own components. Launchpad is only a starting point for building your own applications.
